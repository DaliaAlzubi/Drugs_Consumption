Predictive Model of Psychoactive Drugs Consumption: Based on Classification Machine Learning Algorithms.

 It is hard to tell the impact of drugs on individuals, as the outcome is unpredictable and most often dangerous. For police purposes that concerned with the health of individuals, the problem of predicting drug addiction is quite important. A dataset was used from an open-source website (UCI), that has information about the consumption of 18 psychoactive drugs. we used data mining classification techniques, in order to sort out users and non-users for each drug.  18 classification models were built using different classification techniques, such as; Stochastic gradient descent, Logistic Regression, k-nearest neighbors, Random Forest, and Decision Tree. The most efficient classifier was selected for each model by studying the quality of each one, and it was evaluated by 5-Fold's cross-validation. The results were acquired optimally, and we got 18 models, where each one had different high accurate outputs, that classify an individual to user and non-user. The final model is a series of 18 models for 18 critical psychoactive drugs; Alcohol, Amphet, Amyl, Benzos, Caff, Cannabis, Choc, Coke, Crack, Ecstasy, Heroin, Ketamine, Legalh, LSD, Meth, Mushrooms, Nicotine, and VSA. This study in turn may give a chance for the decision-makers to minimize the risk of these drugs consumption, in order to avoid healthcare issues and keep society safe.
